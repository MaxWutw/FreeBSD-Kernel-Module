# FreeBSD-Kernel-Module
I am currently reading *FreeBSD Device Drivers: A Guide for the Intrepid*, and I plan to write a kernel module for FreeBSD. By using a Kernel Loadable Module (KLD), I can load my own module into the kernel at runtime.
This repository is for practice purposes and serves to record the kernel modules I write.
